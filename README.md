# Customer_Churn_Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Customer Churn dataset of a Telecommunication Services Provider Company to uncover insights into customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention. The analysis is conducted using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.
